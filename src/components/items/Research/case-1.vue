            Farmers of Liyu community practices organic farming or eco-friendly
            farming (i.e. reduced use of agrochemicals) to protect farmland
            ecosystem from ongoing habitat loss and degradation, support
            biodiversity and enhance ecosystem health. On top of that, the
            organic (or eco-growing) rice can not only ensure responsible and
            sustainable production but also enhance human physical health than
            conventional farming.<br />
            <br />
            Regarding the SEPLS management, farmers make use of excess water
            resources in rice paddy and then develop a transformative way to
            control rice blast disease, literally, turning a disadvantage to a
            useful mean. They also implement several practices that can benefit
            crop production and biodiversity conservation mutually, for
            examples, use of Azolla as a green manure in rice cultivation, no
            herbicide spray, and creation of ecological ponds as biological
            refuge during non-growing time (i.e., rice fields would be left
            dried). Crop fields are used for the purpose of environmental
            education, recreation and community events, which strengthen
            consensus among residents, enhance physical and mental health, as
            well as improve human wellbeing of community.<br />
            <br />
            Moreover, with establishing a cross-sectoral platform, Liyu
            community promotes responsible production and consumption (e.g.,
            Participatory Guarantee System) , develops green production chain,
            that can provide adequate economic drivers to pursue the SDGs.

            The Liyu Community is located in Sanyi Township, Miaoli County, has
            a total area of 1,054 hectares, and an elevation ranging from 100 to
            500 meters above sea level. Its hilly terrain has a diverse natural
            habitat and supports numerous terrestrial plants and animals. It is
            surrounded by mountains in the north, south, and east, and features
            well-protected secondary forests along its hillsides. The western
            side is an area with smooth terrain and a slope of less than 10%.
            Its soil is alluvial (i.e., made from Jingshan River's alluvial
            deposits), fertile, rich in nutrients, and suitable for crop
            cultivation, especially rice.<br />
            <br />
            The community is located below the Liyutan Reservoir that has an
            upstream catchment area of 53.5 square kilometers at the Liyu Lake.
            The reservoir was opened in 1992 and has a total storage capacity of
            126 million cubic meters. It mainly supplies water to Miaoli County
            and Taichung City.<br />
            <br />
            Additionally, it is used for irrigation, flood control, power
            generation, and serves as a sightseeing area. Aside from being used
            for the public water supply, the water released from the dam is also
            diverted for irrigation. The irrigated area is 4,147 hectares large,
            with rice being the main crop grown in the area. According to the
            Li-Yu-Tan Reservoir Management Center water quality monitoring data
            from 2004 to 2020, the reservoir water quality is Grade A, meaning
            that the water quality is good and sufficiently provides
            high-quality water for the farmlands in the Liyu Community.

          <h2 class="md-title">Challenges</h2>
          <p class="para">
            Climate extremes (e.g., draught) and insufficient water resources
            may be common challenges that agriculture production is facing with
            globally. Unlike of that, Liyu community is blessed with natural
            resources, including clean water, stable irrigation supply, and
            fertile soil. It is located downstream of the Liyu reservoir
            surrounding by forests, secondary forests, and farmlands, which
            forms the SEPLS in the so-called “Low Elevation Mountain Ecosystem”
            of Taiwan (i.e., attitude lower below 800 m).<br />
            <br />
            There is less human activity and industrial development, leading to
            lower probability of interference upon wildlife. Therefore, the Liyu
            community retains richer biodiversity. However, before 2013, most
            residents practiced conventional farming that is harmful to both
            human and environments. Since then, Residents began to realize the
            interlinkages among biodiversity, responsible production and human
            health and then have been practiced organic/eco-friendly farming
            (e.g., reduced use of agrochemicals) to protect farmland ecosystem
            from ongoing habitat loss and degradation. Besides that, the organic
            (or eco-growing) rice can not only ensure responsible and
            sustainable production but also enhance human physical health than
            conventional farming.

            In recent years, governmental authorities of Taiwan (e.g., COA)
            actively promote the SDG goals and apply practical measures to
            rehabilitate farmland ecosystems. However, few systematic approaches
            have been well addressed. The purpose of this study is to provide
            scientific evidence of farming practices to enhance both human and
            ecosystem health in rural and demonstrate a local-scale implication
            for policy makers. In order to achieve the goal which can be a

          <ol class="list-num-config">
            <li>
              Long-term ecological monitoring provides insight of the benefits
              for organic/eco-friendly farming practices on biodiversity
              conservation. Results indicate that organic/eco-farming rice
              fields support the higher species richness and abundance in
              various taxonomic groups (e.g., aquatic species). It also
              represents significant difference on species richness between
              paddy fields in eco-friendly farming and others in conventional
              practice.

              Regarding the production landscape management, farmers make use of
              excess water resources in rice paddy and then develop a
              transformative way to control rice blast disease, literally,
              turning a disadvantage to a useful mean. Biological pest control
              experiment attempts to discover the mechanisms of natural resource
              management integrating traditional wisdom and culture,
              particularly, emphasis on controlling Golden Apple Snail (GAS)
              population which is threating the food production and local
              incomes. Results show that food waste and several natural fruits
              can serve as effective baits when setting up traps to control GAS
              spread during the early stage of crop growing seasons. Farmers
              also implement other practices that can benefit crop production
              and biodiversity mutually, such as using Azolla as a green manure
              in rice cultivation, no herbicide spray, and creation of
              ecological ponds as biological refuge during non-growing time
              (i.e., rice fields would be left dried).

            <li>
              Liyu community promotes responsible production and consumption
              (PGS), develops green production chain that provides economic
              drivers to pursue sustainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              The systematic implementation demonstrates a practical, repeatable
              framework to government authorities, policy makers and other stake
              holders in terms of evaluating the integrity of ecosystem and its
              response to farming disturbance; then boosts the success of
              actions to conserve and restore biodiversity. With the final
              outcome, it can enhance health of both human and the farmland
              ecosystem.
